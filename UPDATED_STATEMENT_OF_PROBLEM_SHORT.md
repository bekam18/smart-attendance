# 1.2 Statement of the Problem

Attendance tracking in educational institutions faces significant challenges due to manual and semi-automated systems that create inefficiencies and accuracy issues. Current methods present several critical drawbacks:

**Time-Consuming Manual Processes:** Traditional paper-based attendance requires educators to manually mark and verify records, consuming valuable time and introducing human errors, especially in large classrooms.

**Proxy Attendance Vulnerability:** Semi-automated systems like RFID cards are susceptible to misuse through card sharing, enabling unauthorized attendance recording and undermining system integrity.

**Hygiene Concerns:** Physical biometric systems such as fingerprint scanners require contact, raising health risks and reducing user acceptance, particularly post-COVID-19.

**Limited Face Recognition Accuracy:** Existing pre-trained models suffer from bias toward Western datasets, reducing accuracy for African populations. These systems often require ideal lighting and high-end hardware, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained local environments.

This project addresses these limitations by developing a smart attendance system using facial recognition powered by AI. The system leverages deep learning models trained specifically on local student faces, ensuring high recognition accuracy in challenging conditions. Designed to be low-cost, non-intrusive, and capable of operating on standard computing hardware, this approach solves problems of accuracy, speed, and proxy attendance while providing a scalable foundation for future biometric applications in educational settings.
